creating a storage account.
resource "azurerm_storage_account" "storage_account" {
  name                     = "terraformstore10090"
  resource_group_name      = "app-grp"
  location                 = "North US"
  account_tier             = "Standard"
  account_replication_type = "LRS"
}
The storage account service has more properties and hence there are more arguements we can specify here

resource "azurerm_storage_account" "storage_account" {
  name                     = "terraformstore10090"
  resource_group_name      = "app-grp"
  location                 = "North US"
  account_tier             = "Standard"
  account_replication_type = "LRS"
  allow_blob_public_access = true
}
